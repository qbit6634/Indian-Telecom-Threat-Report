## 1. Executive Summary

This report details the identification and analysis of publicly exposed, End-of-Life (EOL) Cisco network devices within the infrastructure of a **Major Indian Telecommunications Provider**. These devices were found running deprecated Cisco IOS-XE firmware (`03.XX.XXE`), rendering them vulnerable to multiple high-severity flaws, including **`CVE-2018-0171` (CVSS 9.8 RCE)** associated with the exposed Cisco Smart Install protocol (`TCP/4786`). Investigation confirmed insecure configurations, such as default SNMP community strings, and detected active reconnaissance from external sources. Critically, **outbound SSH connections were observed** originating from at least one affected device (`Victim-IP-1`) to Command and Control (C2) infrastructure **hosted on Alibaba Cloud in China (`CN-C2-IP-1`)**, confirmed via ASN lookup and geolocation. This observed C2 activity strongly indicates device compromise. The Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) employed are consistent with threat actors like the **Typhoon Family**, known to target critical infrastructure. This incident poses a significant risk and was reported to **CERT-In** and **NCIIPC** (acknowledged under **Incident ID: `CERTIn-84035325`**) and the affected entity.

## 2. Introduction: Context of Threat Actor Research

Cyber threat actors, including state-sponsored groups, persistently target global critical infrastructure. The **Typhoon Family** threat cluster, active since at least 2019, exemplifies this trend, often focusing on telecom, energy, and transportation sectors. Common TTPs include exploiting known vulnerabilities in public-facing edge devices (e.g., Cisco, Fortinet) and using cloud infrastructure for operations. Understanding these methods prompted reconnaissance for similar vulnerabilities within Indian critical infrastructure.

---

## 3. Discovery & Methodology

The following methodology was employed:

- **Public Reconnaissance:** Utilized `Shodan` (`shodan.io`) queries targeting specific banners associated with EOL Cisco IOS-XE versions within Indian IP address ranges.
- **Identification of Vulnerable Assets:** Identified multiple IP addresses (`Victim-IP-1` through `Victim-IP-4`, sanitized) belonging to a Major Indian Telecommunications Provider running the EOL Cisco IOS-XE `03.XX.XXE` firmware.
- **Network & Service Scanning:** Performed `Nmap` TCP and UDP port scans on identified victim IPs, confirming open ports for SSH (`TCP/22`), SNMP (`UDP/161`), and Cisco Smart Install (`TCP/4786`).
- **SNMP Enumeration:** Executed `snmpwalk` using the default `"public"` community string against `UDP/161` on responsive hosts. This retrieved detailed system information (OS version, interfaces, uptime, engine details), confirming the vulnerable firmware and exposing internal configuration data.
- **Connection Analysis & Attribution Support:** Analyzed network connection data, revealing active TCP sessions, including persistent outbound SSH connections from `Victim-IP-1`. Performed ASN lookups and geolocation on destination IPs, confirming the use of **Alibaba Cloud infrastructure in China** for C2.

## 4. Technical Analysis & Findings (Expanded)

### Affected Entity:
- **Major Indian Telecommunications Provider** (Operating National Critical Infrastructure).

### Affected Systems:
- **Sanitized IP Addresses:** `Victim-IP-1`, `Victim-IP-2`, `Victim-IP-3`, `Victim-IP-4`.
- **Device Type:** Identified as Cisco Catalyst L3 Switches and similar Cisco routing/switching equipment, likely functioning as core aggregation or distribution nodes.
- **Firmware:** Cisco IOS-XE Software, Version `03.XX.XXE`. This version is vendor-confirmed **End-of-Life (EOL)** and unsupported, lacking patches for known vulnerabilities.

### Identified Vulnerabilities & Misconfigurations:
- **EOL Firmware Risk:** Operation of EOL firmware constitutes a major security gap, leaving devices perpetually vulnerable to exploitation via numerous public vulnerabilities.
- **`CVE-2018-0171` (CVSS 9.8 - Critical):** Cisco Smart Install RCE vulnerability accessible via exposed `TCP/4786`. Allows potential unauthenticated remote code execution or device disruption.
- **Insecure SNMP (`UDP/161`):**
    - Exposed `SNMPv2c` service using default `"public"` community string, enabling unauthorized remote network reconnaissance and information gathering (OS details, network topology).
    - Associated Vulnerabilities: `CVE-2018-0150` (Info Disclosure), `CVE-2018-0160` (Potential RCE), `CVE-2018-0161` (Buffer Overflow/DoS), compounding the risk of the misconfiguration.
- **Exposed SSH (`TCP/22`):**
    - Publicly accessible SSH service increases the attack surface for brute-force or credential abuse attacks if not strictly controlled via ACLs.
    - Associated Vulnerability: `CVE-2016-6385` (Memory Leak), further indicating the unpatched state of device services.

### Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):
- **Victim Asset Identifiers:**
    - IP Addresses: `Victim-IP-1`, `Victim-IP-2`, `Victim-IP-3`, `Victim-IP-4` *(Specific IPs withheld)*
    - Firmware Version: Cisco IOS-XE `03.XX.XXE`
- **Network IOCs:**
    - Open Ports: `TCP/22`, `TCP/4786`, `UDP/161`
    - Related CVEs: `CVE-2018-0171`, `CVE-2018-0150`, `CVE-2018-0160`, `CVE-2018-0161`, `CVE-2016-6385`
- **Observed Inbound Reconnaissance IPs:** *(ASN/Org included for context)*
    - Multiple IPs hosted on **Alibaba Cloud (China)** *(Specific IPs withheld)*
    - Multiple IPs associated with **US-based scanning/research organizations** (e.g., Censys.io, Palo Alto Networks) *(Specific IPs withheld)*
- **Observed Outbound C2/Connection IP (High Confidence IOC):**
    - `CN-C2-IP-1` **(Hosted on Alibaba Cloud, China)** - Destination IP for observed outbound SSH (`TCP/22`) connections originating from `Victim-IP-1`. **ASN lookup and geolocation confirmed this IP belongs to Alibaba Cloud infrastructure located in China**. This outbound activity is a strong indicator of established device compromise.

## 5. Threat Actor Assessment (Expanded)

While definitive attribution requires extensive forensic data, the observed activity provides indicators for a **tentative assessment** linking it to known threat actor profiles:

- **Key Observed TTPs:**
    - **Targeting EOL Infrastructure:** Focus on unsupported Cisco IOS-XE `03.XX.XXE` devices.
    - **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Targeting high-impact flaws like `CVE-2018-0171` (Smart Install) and SNMP vulnerabilities (`CVE-2018-0150/0160/0161`).
    - **Abuse of Misconfigurations:** Leveraging weak SNMP (`public` community string) for reconnaissance.
    - **Use of Specific Cloud Infrastructure:** Utilizing **Chinese Alibaba Cloud infrastructure** for C2, confirmed by ASN/GeoIP analysis of the outbound C2 destination (`CN-C2-IP-1`).
    - **Sector Targeting:** Focus on the **Telecommunications sector**.

- **Alignment with Known Actors:**
    - This specific combination of TTPs strongly aligns with public reporting on the **Typhoon Family** threat cluster (including **Volt Typhoon**). These actors are documented targeting critical infrastructure globally, including telecoms, often exploiting vulnerabilities in edge devices and using cloud infrastructure (including Alibaba Cloud) for C2.
    - Overlaps exist with other actors (e.g., **APT41**, **RedGolf/Mustang Panda**), but the pattern involving EOL Cisco devices, Smart Install/SNMP vectors, telecom focus, and outbound SSH to confirmed Chinese Alibaba Cloud infrastructure closely matches widely reported Typhoon Family operations.

- **Assessment Conclusion:** The observed outbound SSH connection from `Victim-IP-1` to `CN-C2-IP-1` provides strong evidence of active compromise. The utilized TTPs suggest the responsible party is likely a state-sponsored or state-aligned actor focused on espionage and strategic network access. The **Typhoon Family** profile represents a strong hypothesis based on the current evidence.

## 6. Impact Assessment

A successful compromise of these network devices poses severe risks:

- Potential for large-scale monitoring, interception, or manipulation of network traffic.
- Unauthorized access to sensitive internal network segments and operational data.
- Possibility of service disruption affecting customers and operations.
- Establishment of persistent footholds for long-term intelligence gathering.
- Use of compromised infrastructure as pivot points for broader attacks.

The targeting of national critical infrastructure elevates this to a significant national security concern.
